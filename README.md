# Totally Trivial Trivia!

This project is a trivia game that allows users to test their basic knowledge on superheroes. There is a set amount of questions that the user must answer in a certain amount of time. 

If the user answers all the questions before the time is up, the done button can be pressed and the user's correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions will be displayed on the screen. Likewise, if the timer reaches zero and the user has not finished answering all the questions, the game will automatically end the trivia and display the scores as well.
